#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.

Software engineering plays a crucial role in the field of computer science by enabling the development of advanced software systems. Through a solid foundation in computer science, software engineers learn the proper use of programming languages, algorithms, and software architectures.‍ This knowledge is essential for creating a wide range of applications, from computer games to network control systems. By mastering these skills, software engineers can innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible in the digital world, contributing to the growth and evolution of the software engineering industry.‍
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering is vital as it bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. While IT degree programs focus on managing and maintaining a company's IT infrastructure and assets, software engineering introduces the principles of programming and software development.‍ This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding how to implement and utilize technology effectively in various information systems. Software engineering equips IT professionals with the skills needed to develop, deploy, and maintain software applications, ensuring that technology serves business needs efficiently and effectively.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning & Analysis
This is where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders. This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc. To properly decide what to make, what not to make, and what to make first, you can use a feature prioritization framework that takes into account the value of the software/update, the cost, the time it takes to build, and other factors.
2. Specify the needs
This stage is essential for turning the data acquired during the planning and analysis stage into precise specifications that the development team can follow. This procedure directs the creation of several significant papers, including a Requirement Traceability Matrix document, a Use Case document, and a software requirement specification (SRS) or product specification.
3. Design Phhase
Here, A software design document (SDD), which comprises the system design, programming language, templates, platform to be used, and application security measures, is an elaborated version of the initial plan and vision. You can also use this to create a flowchart showing how the program reacts to user input.
4. Progress
The development team members break the project down into software modules and translate the software requirements into code that creates the final product during the actual development phase.
5. Testing
Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do.
6. The deployment
Your intended user receives your finished product during the deployment step. Depending on the type, you can plan your deployment and automate this process.
7. Maintenance. The main goal of maintenance is to monitor the application continuously to identify issues that arise once it is in production.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall Methodology This highly structured approach is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, such as large-scale infrastructure projects like building an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, where all requirements must be clearly defined upfront. The Waterfall model is a sequential and linear process that requires each phase—such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance—to be finished before going on to the next.
Agile Methodology 
Agile Methodology is a flexible and iterative approach that prioritizes collaboration, continuous feedback, and the quick delivery of small product increments. Agile teams operate in short cycles, known as sprints, where they frequently reevaluate priorities and make necessary adjustments. Agile allows for flexibility, which makes it appropriate for projects with changing requirements. For instance, Agile is perfect for developing a startup's mobile app, where customer feedback is essential and the product may require frequent changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. 
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional.
A project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are tools that offer all features that may be necessary for software development. For example, VS code IDE which is used mostly in web development for front-end and back-end parts of software in a software development project
Version Control Systems (VCS) are used to monitor and record every change made to the software. eg. Git to monitor changes that occur in the software development project for instance a code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Adapting to Technology That Is Changing Quickly
With the frequent release of new programming languages, frameworks, and tools, technology is always changing. Software engineers may find it challenging to remain current and applicable in their field as a result. Outdated skills and fewer job opportunities can arise from lagging behind industry trends.
Solution
Engineers should schedule time for ongoing education via industry conferences, tech blogs, and online courses to stay current. Engineers can also work with the developer community and obtain practical experience with new technologies by taking part in open-source projects.
2. Troubleshooting Complicated Problems
Software engineers frequently devote a large amount of their time to debugging and resolving problems in large or legacy codebases. Debugging can be difficult, particularly when working with unknown code or subtle, hard-to-trace errors.
Solution
Developers can gain new insights and clarity by using the rubber duck debugging technique, which involves explaining the issue out loud. Errors can also be found and fixed by segmenting the code into smaller parts and employing binary search debugging, which involves turning off specific parts of the code to isolate the problem.
3. Handling Strict Due Dates
Strict deadlines are frequently imposed on software projects, which can result in heightened stress, hurried development, and possible burnout. Unrealistic expectations, scope creep, or ineffective project management can all lead to tight deadlines.
Solution
Projects can be divided into smaller, more manageable tasks by implementing Agile approaches like Scrum or Kanban. Critical work is finished first when tasks are prioritized using frameworks such as the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent vs. important). To control expectations and lessen needless stress, stakeholders must be effectively informed about reasonable timelines.
4. Challenges in Collaboration and Communication
As a team endeavor, software development necessitates smooth cooperation between developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders. Project delays, duplication of effort, and misunderstandings can result from poor coordination or miscommunication.
Solution
Task management and communication can be streamlined by using collaboration tools like Asana, Jira, or Slack. All team members will have access to crucial information if there is clear documentation. Frequent stand-up meetings promote a more effective and cohesive work environment by keeping everyone informed about project progress, obstacles, and next steps.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit tests
Unit tests are extremely basic and closely related to an application's source code. They entail testing specific functions and methods of the classes, parts, or modules that your software uses. Unit tests can be executed quickly by a continuous integration server and are typically fairly inexpensive to automate.
2. Integration tests
Integration tests confirm that the various services or modules your application uses are compatible with one another. Testing the database interaction or ensuring that microservices cooperate as intended are two examples. Since these tests necessitate the operation of several application components, they are more costly to conduct.
3. System testing examines every component of an application to make sure that they works as a complete and unified whole.
4. Acceptance testing
Formal tests known as acceptance tests are used to confirm whether a system meets business needs. They concentrate on simulating user behaviors and necessitate that the entire application be operational during testing. However, they can also go one step further and assess the system's performance, rejecting modifications if specific objectives are not fulfilled.
Importance of software testing
Risk Mitigation: Testing helps identify defects and failures early in the development process when they are less expensive to fix. As a result, project risks about performance, security, and quality are decreased.
Confidence: Before the software is released, a well-thought-out software test strategy can be implemented to ensure that it functions as intended.
Compliance: Software can be tested to make sure it complies with rules, regulations, and compliance specifications. This is particularly important for safety-critical systems.
User Satisfaction: Thorough testing conducted from the viewpoint of the user can confirm compatibility, functionality, and usability. This improves user or customer satisfaction and lessens the harm that subpar products can do to a company's finances or reputation.
Software quality, user experience, security, performance, and other product attributes can all be continuously improved with the help of optimization and testing, which offers crucial feedback.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts—questions or instructions—to elicit specific responses from AI models.
Enhances Response Accuracy
Clear instructions from a well-structured prompt lessen the possibility of ambiguous or unrelated responses. For instance, a more focused and accurate response is obtained when the prompt is more specific, such as "Explain the key differences between machine learning and deep learning in AI," rather than "Tell me about AI."
Improves Context Understanding
To produce answers, AI models rely on the data in the prompt. Responses can be better tailored to the needs of the user by including context, such as identifying the target audience (beginner, expert, etc.) or offering background information.
Maximizes AI Capabilities
Summarization, code generation, translation, and creative writing are just a few of the many tasks that sophisticated AI models are capable of. These capabilities can be unlocked through prompt engineering, which structures prompts to take advantage of the model’s strengths, 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about programming." Improved Prompt: "Provide a beginner-friendly explanation of object-oriented programming (OOP), including its four main principles with examples."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
More Specific – Instead of asking generally about "programming," it focuses on "object-oriented programming (OOP)."
Well-Defined Scope – It limits the topic to "four main principles," ensuring a structured response.
Clear Expectations – It specifies that examples should be included, making the explanation more practical and understandable.
Concise and Focused – The refined prompt eliminates vagueness, leading to a more informative and useful answer.
